--- Original Description ---

Mechanical and Mechanite augmentations, for both subtle and invasive augmentation needs.

- Adds a range of surgically installed mechanite based augmentations as well as a few mechanical augmentation items.

* Adds Mechanite Injectors with commercial strains of Fibrous and Sensory Mechanites, Mechanites comes in four grades with scaling strength and sideeffects if improperly maintained.
* Fibrous and Sensory Mechanites dramatically enhances a pawns movement, manipulation and sensory capability.
* Injected Mechanites will expire and burn out one year after installation. And requires maintenance once a week for peak performance.

* Adds a small range of psuedo-bionics and implants. Including but not limited to.
* Four types of eye prostethic of scaling effectiveness.
* Toxin Scrubber lung implants
* Psionic Shield skull implant
* extendable/retractable Badger Claw hand implants
* Hydraulic arms, legs and spine cybernetics.

List of features and items subject to change, or if some other implant mod adopts them. There are no prima donnas among engineers, I fail to see why modding should not be similar.
